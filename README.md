# I finally have a .dotfiles repo!

## For anyone else who wants to use it

- My terminal environment uses `ZSH` as primary shell
- It uses `oh-my-zsh` prompt
- Uses `p10k (powerlevel10k)` theme with minor modifications
  
## What is each .dotfile for?

It currently includes just 2 .dotfiles:

- `.zshrc` is your standard `zsh` config file
- `.p10k.zsh` is config file after you run `p10k configure`

*Note: Both of these files reside in home directory i.e. `~/`*

## New machine setup script

To setup new machine, dev enviornments and so on, this script will save you hours! Simply run it (`bash homebrew.sh`) or go through it and selectively comment out what to install and what not to install :)
