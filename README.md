# I finally have a `.dotfiles` repo!

## For anyone else who wants to use it

- My terminal environment uses `ZSH` as primary shell
- It uses `oh-my-zsh` prompt
- Uses `p10k (powerlevel10k)` theme with minor modifications
  
## What is each `.dotfile` for?

There are multiple `.dotfiles`, each configuring a different tool/setting.
You can edit each individual one you want or if you prefer my default settings then:

1. Download [Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)
2. Choose Dracula Theme (My Personal Choice and default for these `.dotfiles` to fit with)
3. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
4. Simply run `sh homebrew.sh`
5. Viola! everything should be in place. If you face any difficulty, please raise an issue :).

*Note: Both of these files reside in home directory i.e. `~/`*

## New machine setup script

To setup new machine, dev enviornments and so on, this script will save you hours! Simply run it (`sh homebrew.sh`) or go through `Brewfile` and selectively remove/keep what all you want to install :)
